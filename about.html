            <p>
                I'm a chem/bioengineer by training and ran an ephemerally successful consumer electronics/medical device startup called Clip Health, making at-home diagnostics, for 9 years beginning in 2014. </p> <p>After Clip shut down late last year, I took a few months off and am now actively looking to start a NewCo. While I'm open to any and all industries including AI, SaaS, energy, space tech, and robotics given the right cofounder, I'm most drawn to ambitious problems in medicine or biotech tools given my background. My technical expertise from my PhD and running Clip span electromechanical hardware, biochemistry, materials science, and surface chemistry. I'd love to riff on startup ideas if you're an ambitious founder in between things or chat about challenges at your current startup if useful - bala@balaraja.net. </p>

<p>In my role as CEO of Clip, which spun out of my/cofounder's PhD and raised $54M over its lifetime from YC, VCs, and the federal government, I helped build v1 of the product in the early years and later, after raising money, led fundraising, product, sales, business development, QA/RA, and manufacturing. Our original goal was to make at-home rapid tests for STDs but that was hard to raise FDA clinical trial money for despite 98% accuracy in an overseas trial, so we went all-in on covid when the pandemic hit. We were in the right place at the right time with mature-enough technology, so the covid pivot worked out in our favor for a couple of years, with the company growing from 6 people to nearly 150 in a year. We manufactured ~1.5M units—in-house end-to-end in California with a fair amount of automation—of an FDA-approved product family for rapid covid testing and shipped a good portion of them to make $7M in revenue but failed to parlay that success into sustainable growth, shutting down in August 2023. The last 6-9 months of Clip's life was focused on an (ultimately unsuccessful) hail-mary hard pivot into a home-use product for post-discharge heart failure monitoring to lower the probability of readmissions. My PhD (2009-14) focused on developing easy-to-use biosensing technologies; these included a microfluidic device for detection of potential bioterror agents and an array of rapid point-of-care tests for bacterial diagnostics.
